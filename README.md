Since 2010, Google has released transparency reports to “shed light on how the policies and actions of governments and corporations affect privacy, security, and access to information online”. More specifically, the data released gives critical statistics on various governments’ inquiries to view user data and remove Google services’ content. A subset of the information released by Google pertains specifically to criminal investigations. In this area, police can request information from Google to aid in suspect identification and sentencing. According to the Washington Post and Bloomberg, while access to user information expedites the crime-solving process, the practice threatens the public's privacy and nears being unconstitutional. Amid this controversial practice lies potentially valuable statistical insights. This report delves into Google’s transparency data from the first half of 2011, focusing on requests related to criminal investigations.
